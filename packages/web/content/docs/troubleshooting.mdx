description: Common issues and how to fix them.
---

This guide covers common issues you might encounter when using Arctic and how to resolve them.

## Installation Issues

### Binary not found after install

If you installed with the script but can't run `arctic`:

```bash
# Check if it's in PATH
which arctic

# If not found, restart your shell or add to PATH manually
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Add the export to your shell config (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.config/fish/config.fish`).

### Permission denied on install

If the install script fails with permission errors:

```bash
# Create the directory first
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin

# Run install script again
curl -fsSL https://usearctic.sh/install | bash
```

### Windows PowerShell execution policy error

If you get an error about execution policy:

```powershell
# Set execution policy for current session
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process

# Then run install again
irm https://usearctic.sh/install.ps1 | iex
```

## Authentication Issues

### Auth login fails or hangs

If `arctic auth login` doesn't work:

```bash
# Check your network connection
ping api.github.com

# Try clearing auth and retrying
rm ~/.config/arctic/auth.json
arctic auth login
```

### API key not detected

If you set an environment variable but Arctic doesn't see it:

```bash
# Verify the variable is set
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Check for typos (case sensitive)
# Correct: OPENAI_API_KEY
# Wrong: openai_api_key

# Restart your shell after setting the variable
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

### OAuth token expired

If you get authentication errors after using OAuth:

```bash
# Logout and login again
arctic auth logout
arctic auth login
```

## TUI Issues

### TUI looks broken or has artifacts

If the terminal UI doesn't render correctly:

```bash
# Reset your terminal
reset

# Try a different terminal if issues persist
# Known issues with: old Terminal.app versions, tmux with certain configs
```

### Keybindings not working

If keyboard shortcuts don't respond:

```bash
# Check for keybinding conflicts in config
arctic debug config

# Try default keybindings by removing keybinds from config
# Edit ~/.config/arctic/arctic.json and remove the "keybinds" section
```

### Mouse selection copies everything

By default, mouse selection copies in Arctic. To disable or customize:

```json
{
  "selection": {
    "mouse": false
  }
}
```

## Session Issues

### Session not found

If `arctic run --continue` says session not found:

```bash
# List available sessions
arctic session list

# Use the correct session ID
arctic run --session <session-id> "..."
```

### Can't resume session

If you can't resume a session:

```bash
# Check if session exists
arctic session list

# Verify you're in the correct directory (project detection)
pwd
git status  # verify git repo if applicable
```

### Session history too long

If a session is slow to load due to history:

```bash
# Compact the session
arctic run --command compact

# Or start a new session
arctic
# In TUI: Ctrl+X N
```

## Tool Issues

### Permission denied for tools

If tools keep getting denied:

```bash
# Check your permissions config
arctic debug config

# Or temporarily allow all tools (use with caution)
# In ~/.config/arctic/arctic.json:
{
  "permission": {
    "edit": "allow",
    "bash": { "*": "allow" },
    "webfetch": "allow"
  }
}
```

### Bash tool not working

If bash commands fail:

```bash
# Verify bash is in PATH
which bash

# Check Arctic has execute permissions
arctic debug file read /tmp/test.txt
```

### File operations fail

If read/write/edit tools fail:

```bash
# Check file permissions
ls -la <file>

# Verify Arctic has access to the directory
arctic debug file read <path>
```

## MCP Issues

### MCP server not connecting

If MCP tools don't appear:

```bash
# Check MCP configuration
arctic mcp list

# Verify server is running (for local MCP)
arctic mcp auth

# Check MCP logs if available
```

### MCP tools timeout

If MCP tools are slow or timeout:

```bash
# Increase timeout in config
{
  "mcp": {
    "my-server": {
      "timeout": 10000
    }
  }
}
```

## Performance Issues

### Slow responses

If Arctic feels slow:

```bash
# Try a faster model
arctic models  # to see options
# In TUI: Ctrl+X M to switch

# Check your network connection
ping api.anthropic.com
```

### High memory usage

If Arctic uses too much memory:

```bash
# Compact old sessions
arctic session list
arctic run --command compact

# Delete old sessions you don't need
arctic session delete <session-id>
```

## Configuration Issues

### Config not loading

If changes to config don't take effect:

```bash
# Verify config file location
cat ~/.config/arctic/arctic.json

# Check for JSON syntax errors
# Use a JSON validator or:
python3 -m json.tool ~/.config/arctic/arctic.json

# Restart Arctic after config changes
```

### Config precedence confusion

If you have multiple config files:

```bash
# Debug config to see what's loaded
arctic debug config

# Config precedence:
# 1. Global: ~/.config/arctic/arctic.json
# 2. Project: <worktree>/.arctic/arctic.json
# 3. Environment: ARCTIC_CONFIG or ARCTIC_CONFIG_CONTENT
```

## Snapshots Issues

### Snapshot restore fails

If you can't restore a snapshot:

```bash
# Check snapshot exists

# Verify snapshot hash
arctic debug snapshot diff <hash>

# Ensure working directory is clean
git status
git stash
```

### Snapshots not working

If snapshots aren't created:

```bash
# Check if Git is installed
which git

# Verify snapshots are enabled in config
arctic debug config

# Ensure snapshot: true in config
{
  "snapshot": true
}
```

## Debug Mode

For persistent issues, enable debug logging:

```bash
# Enable debug mode
ARCTIC_DEBUG=1 arctic

# Or set in environment
export ARCTIC_DEBUG=1
arctic
```

## Getting Help

If you can't resolve your issue:

1. Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/arctic-cli/interface/issues) for similar problems
2. Run debug commands and gather output:

```bash
arctic debug config
arctic mcp list
arctic session list
```

3. Create a new issue with:
   - Your OS and version
   - Arctic version (`arctic --version`)
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Error messages or debug output

## Common Error Messages

### "Provider not found"

### "Rate limit exceeded"

You've hit the provider's rate limit.

```bash
# Check usage
arctic run --command usage

# Wait for the limit to reset or use a different provider
```

### "Session not found"

```bash
# List sessions
arctic session list

# Check current directory

```

### "Permission denied"

A tool is being blocked by permissions.

```bash
# Check your permissions config
arctic debug config
