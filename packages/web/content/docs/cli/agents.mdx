Agents are specialized assistants with custom prompts and tool rules.

## Create an agent

```bash
arctic agent create
```

Agents are stored as markdown files with frontmatter in:

- Project: `.arctic/agent/*.md`
- Global: `~/.config/arctic/agent/*.md`

### Import from Claude Code

Arctic can import agents from Claude Code on first launch:

- Project agents: `.claude/agents/` → `.arctic/agent/claude/`
- Global agents: `~/.claude/agents/` → `~/.config/arctic/agent/claude/`

You'll be prompted once. Imported agents work immediately and can be selected via `Ctrl+X A` or `@agent-name` in prompts.

## Agent file format

```md
---
description: "Writes backend APIs"
mode: primary
model: "provider/model"
tools:
  bash: true
  edit: true
  write: true
  webfetch: false
permission:
  edit: ask
  bash:
    "*": ask
---

You are a backend assistant. Focus on services, data, and API design.
```

## Modes

- `primary`: main assistant
- `subagent`: callable via task tool
- `all`: both primary and subagent

## Use an agent

- TUI: `Ctrl+X A`
- CLI: `arctic run --agent <name> "..."`

## Remove an agent

Delete the file from `.arctic/agent` (project) or `~/.config/arctic/agent` (global).
