Arctic is a multi‑provider AI coding CLI. It keeps providers, usage limits, and sessions in one place.

## Quick start

```bash
arctic
```

This opens the TUI (terminal UI).

## One‑off prompts

```bash
arctic run "summarize this repo"
```

Pipe stdin or attach files:

```bash
cat README.md | arctic run "rewrite this"
arctic run -f ./src/index.ts "review this file"
```
